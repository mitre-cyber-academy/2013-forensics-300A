Name: Upgrade Time

Description: You've just upgraded your system to the latest version of Debian. Unfortunately, something in the update has broken your graphics. It's too bad you decided to `lock down' your system by disabling non-graphical logins...

How To Solve: Unzip the image. Mount the vmdk using vmware-mount. Copy the good
xorg.conf into /etc/X11/xorg.conf. Boot the machine. Edit the menus, notice that
the menu images spell out the flag.
